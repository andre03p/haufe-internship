Build a functional product capable of performing automated code reviews, providing 
valuable insights and recommendations for developers.

Your solution should analyze source code, detect potential issues, and assist in improving code quality. 
Use AI where appropriate — ideally through a locally hosted Large Language Model (LLM)
 to ensure privacy, performance, and innovation.


The solution runs successfully and performs basic code review tasks.	
The system performs analysis using a locally hosted LLM.	
Perform code review before submitting changes (e.g., pre-commit hook or staged review).	
Support reviewing only newly added or changed code segments.	
Allow discussion or feedback resolution directly within review comments.	
Provide automatic code fixes or refactoring options based on findings.	
Estimate the development effort required to apply suggested changes.	
Incorporate standard coding guidelines (e.g., PEP8, Google Style) in reviews.	
Allow importing or defining custom coding standards or rulesets.	
Include multiple dimensions of analysis (e.g., linting, security, architecture, testing, CI/CD).	
Generate clear explanations and detailed recommendations for each finding.	
Recommend documentation updates relevant to reviewed or changed code.	
Efficient execution, fast analysis times, and resource-conscious design.	
Implement token or resource usage tracking to control AI-related costs.	
Intuitive, modern, and visually appealing interface.	
Smooth workflow, minimal friction for users.	
Clear, accurate, and actionable review feedback.
